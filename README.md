# cancerAlign
cancerAlign: use adversarial learning to align different cancer types
# Introduction
cancerAlign is an unsupervised approach to stratify tumors through learning tumor alignment across cancer types. It utilizes the adversarial learning to learn a shared latent space between the somatic mutation profile of a target cancer type and a source cancer type. Tumors of the target cancer type are then clustered in this shared latent space so that common patterns across cancer types can be exploited to assist the stratification. 
# Dataset
patients' mutation data are in raw_survival/\*\_mut.txt &nbsp; * are cancer type names\
patients' survival data are in raw_survival/\*\_surv.txt_clean &nbsp; * are cancer type names\
A preprocessed file that contains the cancer type, mutatated genes for each patient: data.csv\
A known cancer gene list known_cancer_genes.csv
# How to run
To run the cancerAlign for a specific target cancer type:
 <pre><code>python3 run.py  --target="cancer type name"</code></pre>
# How to see output
To generate the final clustering labels of a target cancer type when number of clusters is k by cancerAlign:
 <pre><code>python3 final_cluster.py  --target="cancer type name" --num_clusters=k</code></pre>
It would generate a file (target cancer type)\_k.txt. For example, for BLCA and k=2, the file name is BLCA\_2.txt. Inside the file, first column is patient names, second column is corresponding labels.\
To generate cancer genes produced by cancerAlign:
 <pre><code>python3 cancer_genes.py  --target="cancer type name"</code></pre>
 It would print top 10 genes generated by cancerAlign for the target cancer type.
